# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which bundle data (properties) and behaviors (methods) together.

It promotes code reusability, modularity, and scalability.
## Key principles of Object-Oriented Programming
- Encapsulation: bundling data and methods into a single unit (object). For example, a `User` object with `name`, `email`, and `login()` method

- Abstraction: hiding implementation details and exposing only what is necessary. For example, A `Car` object has a `start()` method, but the user doesn't need to know how it works internally

- Inheritance: creating new objects based on existing ones. For example, A `Student` class can inherit properties from a `Person` class

- Polymorphism: objects can share the same method name but behave differently. For example, a `Shape` class has a `draw()` method, but `Circle` and `Rectangle`ss implement it differently
