# Package Managers
A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software dependencies (packages) in JavaScript projects.

Dependencies in programming refer to the scenario where one piece of software relies on another to function correctly.
There are two types of Dependencies Direct dependencies and transitive dependencies:

- Direct dependencies: Direct dependencies are the core frameworks, modules, and libraries that the code directly calls to perform specific functionalities These dependencies are explicitly mentioned in the code and are essential for the software to operate. For example, in a JavaScript project, these dependencies are listed in the package.json file.

- Transitive dependencies: Transitive dependencies are the dependencies of direct dependencies. These are not directly used in the code but are required by the components that the developer uses. For instance, if software directly depends on module A, and module A depends on module B, then the software indirectly depends on module B and module B is a transitive dependency.


JavaScript has three major package managers (for managing dependencies):

1. npm (Node Package Manager)-The default package manager for Node.js.

2. Yarn-Developed by Facebook as an alternative to npm, offering better performance and security.

3. pnpm-A modern package manager that uses a more efficient way of handling dependencies by creating a global store.
